# Self Hosted Sponsorship

## Introduction 

I’m attempting to diversify my income via three legs:

- Full time / freelance / contract employment 
- SAAS businesses / rental of assets 
- Sponsorships 

This repository captures my notes and setup of my sponsorships. In particular my self hosted sponsorship platform (https://supporters.reachableceo.com).

## Sponsorship platforms I’m using 

### GitHub Sponsors
### Patreon
### Twitch 
### YouTube (once I hit enough subscribers)
### Discord 
### Self hosted 
### Open Streaming Platform 

## Back office 

Currently Dolibarr doesn’t have a full e-commerce solution:

As such , a combination of Dolibarr and WooCommerce provides our backoffice needs. 

- Dolibarr ERP (integrated instance across freelance and sponsorship channels)

- Woocommerce (associated plugins TBD )
