# Self Hosted Sponsorship

## Introduction 

I’m attempting to diversify my income via three legs:

- Full time / freelance / contract employment 
- SAAS businesses / rental of assets 
- Sponsorships 

This repository captures my notes and setup of my sponsorships. In particular my self hosted sponsorship platform (https://supporters.reachableceo.com).

## Self Hosted Content/Sponsorship Platforms I’m Using 

## Front Office

- Open Streaming Platform 
- Ghost
- Grav
- WooCommerce
- Bookme

## Back office 

Currently Dolibarr doesn’t have a full e-commerce solution per: 
<https://www.dolibarr.org/presentation-ecommerce.php>

As such , a combination of Dolibarr and WooCommerce covers my backoffice needs. 

- Dolibarr ERP (integrated instance across freelance and sponsorship channels). Rental channel is managed in the Starting Line Productions ERP.

- Woocommerce (associated plugins TBD )
