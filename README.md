# Self Hosted Sponsorship

## Introduction 

I’m attempting to diversify my income via three legs:

- Full time / freelance / contract employment 
- SAAS businesses / rental of assets 
- Sponsorships 

This repository captures my notes and setup of my sponsorships. In particular my self hosted sponsorship platform (https://supporters.reachableceo.com).

## Sponsorship platforms I’m using 

GitHub Sponsors
Patreon
Twitch 
YouTube (once I hit enough subscribers)
Discord 
Self hosted 

## Back office 

Dolibarr ERP (integrated instance across freelance and sponsorship channels)
